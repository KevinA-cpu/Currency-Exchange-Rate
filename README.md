# Currency-Transfer-Rate
A program created using Socket to get information about the transfer rate of multiple currencies from an API and deliver it to end-users
This project was created for the subject Networking by HCMUS students.

A few explanations if you want to use/referencing this script:
  + Server.exe might not run, since I no longer have my SQL Server run all the time, Server.exe was built using codes in the side server folder.
  
side server folder is only different from host server in how connection to SQL is establish, since my intention was that if you run the side server code, you will connect to the database on my computer, no further set up needed.
 
while host server will require you to download Microsoft SQL management tools, create the database yourself on your local computer (database script provided in db folder) then you can run the script, you might have to change some information in the SQL connection code.
 
 This project is in no way perfect, but it works flawlessly and it is not broken.
